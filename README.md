# gapi-node
There are 3 objectives to this repo: 
1) show example and describe a way to call Google API the easiest way from within a node.js website.
2) explore current options to make those calls (the various libraries available), 
3) explane the JWT internals (base64, signing, etc.) used by the code used in #1 above.
