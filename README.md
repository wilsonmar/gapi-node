# Objectives of this repo : gapi-node
This repo was created to meet these objectives: 

1. show a [demo example website](https://wilsonmar.github.com/gapi-node) 
and describe how it calls a Google API (using JWT) from within a node.js server.
2. explore current options to make those calls (the various libraries available), 
3. explain JWT construction internals (base64, signing, etc.) used by the code used in #1 above.
4. show additional variations on use of Google API, such as Reports API to collect and display data Google collects.

Videos have been created to make dynamic reveal of illustrations with spoken text.

# Why?
The following is the narration to a video on YouTube.com and DailyMotion.com.

This tutorial is a guided exploration for developers to quickly learn, in a hands-on way, how to perform server-to-server communication with Google's many web services.
Google provides a large number of APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) so programs in servers can communicate with other computers directly without human interaction: Information from users of Google's Gmail, Calendar, Drive cloud, Google+, and YouTube videos.
Why would one want to take the extra effort to extract data from Google when one has Gmail, Google maps, and other websites that Google provides? 

Let's take a look at this line chart showing corresponding data series across time.

If you want to add event flags or additional data not in Google servers you might need to have all the data on your own server. Also, since Google automatically purges data on its schedule, Google has been known to cancel services it has provided. So you need a way of keeping your data where you really control.

To extract data from Google's servers:

As an example in this tutorial, we use Google's URL Shortener service at this scope address because one doesn’t need to stand-up a custom server to work with the URL Shortener service Google provides.

Google’s goo.gl website converts long URLs into short URLs for inclusion within tweets or quicker typing in keyboards.
Google also provides an API Explorer, a Playground, and the code.google.com website for exploring calls made on behalf of a 
Google user signed in. These sites mock how approved sites can use Google's API to generate shortUrls.

Behind the scenes within each of these websites, there needs to be calls to Google’s authentication service so Google can enforce limits on how many calls are made.

Because Google maintain statistics on where and when each shortUrl is created and invoked by the public, Google can display statistics on its web pages but also offer statistics to custom web sites through its Reports API.
But first, a Node.js library such as this (which we'll be talking more about later) is used ¬¬¬¬to authenticate with Google using credentials Google assigns through its Developer Console for a particular project associated with a Google account. 

The authentication token assembled are sent to Google's authentication server to obtain an access token that will be sent along with requests for conversion. When an access token expires, the refresh token provided by Google is used to obtain more access tokens.

# Interactive Demo Client
The sample app shown at https://wilsonmar.github.com/gapi-node 
is structured like an app that calls the Google API.

1. Type out a URL you would like to shorten and click "Shorten".
2. The response is the shortened URL 
3. The QR code image generated by Google.
4. The URL is added to the list of URLs in the drop-down.
5. Statistics presented is for the URL selected from the list.

Alternately, you may prefer to make these calls for a list of URLs from a batch program.

# Different ways to access a Google API

The remainder of this tutorial takes a "deep dive" into the different ways Google's URL Shortener service can be accessed.

1.	Obtain short URL manually from goo.gl as an anonymous user [goo.gl][]
2.	Obtain short URL manually as a signed-in Google user
3.	Obtain short URL manually using Node.js command line
4.	Obtain short URL from Google's Node.js program 
5.	Get list of short URLs from Google's API Console for known user
6.	Obtain short URL manually using Google's API Playground

Additional considerations:

g)	Public API access
h)	Use Google's Developer Console to define projects, service accounts, and private keys
i)	.p12 file and cryptography
j)	Store and retrieve private keys securely
k)	Make web service (API) call to Google servers
l)	Manually retrieve report on short URL resolution history 
m)	Retrieve report on short URL resolution history using Node.js

## Obtain short URLs manually from goo.gl as an anonymous user [goo.gl] ##
As an introduction to how Google’s URL Shortener API service works, let’s first look at the human user interface which web services APIs will replace.

1.	Type in the browser address box Google's URL Shortener home page at http://goo.gl/.
2.	Click Sign in and provide your Google password.
Notice that the URL processed recently does not appear on the list of URLs because it was created under Google's account. URLs previously shortened using your Google account should show up on this page. 
3.	Type or paste URL maps.google.com (or other URL of your choice) in the text box under "Paste your long URL here".  (http:// is not needed). 
4.	Double-click on the long URL and press Ctrl or command+C to save it in your clipboard for use later.
5.	Press Shorten URL. 
6.	Paste the long URL and shorten it again.
7.	Press Ctrl or command+C to save it to your clipboard.

# Server
In order to not expose credentials in client code, calls to the Google API needs to be made from a server. In our case, from a node.js server. The sample server code is based on use of ???

# JWT vs. JWS vs. JWE

## JWT
JWS is an example of JWT defined in the IETF draft at https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-oauth-json-web-token-32.
JSON Web Token (JWT) is a compact, URL-safe means of representing claims to be transferred between two parties.  The claims in a JWT are encoded as a JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) object that is used as the payload of a JSON Web Signature (JWS) structure or as the plaintext of a JSON Web Encryption (JWE) structure, enabling the claims to be digitally signed or MACed and/or encrypted.

## JWS
(https://github.com/brianloveswords/node-jws)
implements the creation of a
JSON Web Signature (JWS) as defined in http://self-issued.info/docs/draft-ietf-jose-json-web-signature.html
JSON Web Signature (JWS) represents content secured with digital signatures or Message Authentication Codes (MACs) using JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) based data structures. Cryptographic algorithms and identifiers for use with this specification are described in the separate JSON Web Algorithms (JWA) specification and an IANA registry defined by that specification. Related encryption capabilities are described in the separate JSON Web Encryption (JWE) specification.
