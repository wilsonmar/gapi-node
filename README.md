# <a name="Interactive_demo_client"></a> Interactive Demo Client to Shorten Long URLs
The sample app shown at https://wilsonmar.github.com/gapi-node 
makes calls to the Google API URL Shortener [first made available in 2009](http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2009/12/making-urls-shorter-for-google-toolbar.html).

1. Type out a URL you would like to shorten and click "Shorten".
2. The response is the shortened URL 
3. The QR code image generated by Google.
4. The URL is added to the list of URLs in the drop-down.
5. Statistics presented is for the URL selected from the list.

The sample is similar to other web pages created:
* http://gaigalas.net/lab/googl
* [Chrome web store app](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/googl-url-shortener/iblijlcdoidgdpfknkckljiocdbnlagk)
* http://hayageek.com/examples/urlshortener-api/index.php

The functionality of these web pages can be implemented as a plug-in within several frameworks:
* https://wordpress.org/plugins/googl/

Sample client code in various other programming languages have been published :
* PHP : https://code.google.com/p/php-url-shortener/
* Apple Objective-C : https://code.google.com/p/google-api-objectivec-client/
* Go language : https://godoc.org/code.google.com/p/google-api-go-client/urlshortener/v1
* .NET : https://developers.google.com/api-client-library/dotnet/apis/urlshortener/v1


# <a name="Workflow_diagram"></a> Workflow to use Google for shortening URLs

This illustration shows how data is input into and output from Google's servers:

![Data flow](http://www.merc.tv/img/fig/goo.dataflow_v01.png "Data flow")

Among the many services Google provides, in this tutorial, we use Google's URL Shortener service  (at this scope address https://www.googleapis.com/auth/urlshortener/v1/) because one doesn’t need to stand-up a custom server in the Google Cloud to work with the URL Shortener service Google provides.

Google’s goo.gl website converts long URLs into short URLs for inclusion within tweets or for quicker typing in keyboards.
Google also provides an API Explorer, a Playground, and the code.google.com website for exploring calls made on behalf of a 
Google user signed in. These sites mock how approved sites can use Google's API to generate shortUrls.

Behind the scenes within each of these websites, there needs to be calls to Google’s **authentication service** so Google can enforce limits on how many calls are made.

Because Google maintain statistics on where and when each shortUrl is created and invoked by the public, Google can display statistics on its web pages but also offer statistics to custom web sites through its Reports API.
But first, a Node.js library such as this (which we'll be talking more about later) is used to authenticate with Google using credentials Google assigns through its Developer Console for a particular project associated with a Google account. 

The authentication token assembled are sent to Google's authentication server to obtain an access token that will be sent along with requests for conversion. When an access token expires, the refresh token provided by Google is used to obtain more access tokens.

# <a name="Client_API_access"></a> Different ways to access the URL Shortener Google API:

The remainder of this tutorial takes a "deep dive" into the different ways Google's URL Shortener service can be accessed. 

1.	[Obtain short URL manually from goo.gl as an anonymous user](#from_goo.gl_anon)
2.	[Obtain short URL manually from goo.gl as a signed-in Google user](#from_goo.gl_signed_in)
3.	[Obtain short URL manually using Node.js command line](#from_node_cli)
4.	[Obtain short URL manually using Google's API Playground](#from_playground)
5.	[Obtain short URL manually using Google Code](#from_devtools)
4.	[Obtain short URL from Google's Node.js program](#from_google_node_js)

Along the way, we consider several technical details:

<hr />

## <a name="from_goo.gl_anon"></a> Obtain short URLs manually from goo.gl as an anonymous user
As an introduction to how Google’s URL Shortener API service works, let’s look at the human user interface which web services APIs replace.

1.	Use the Google Chrome browser. If you do not have one installed, install it from http://google.com/chrome.
2.	Sign out of your Google account.
3.	Type in the browser omni bar Google's URL Shortener home page at http://goo.gl/.
4.	Type or paste a URL of your choice (such as maps.google.com) in the box under "Paste your long URL here". 
(http:// is not needed).
5.	Click the "I'm not a robot" checkbox. (This scheme activated September 2014 does not require input of random words, as described at http://www.wikiwand.com/en/ReCAPTCHA).
6.	Click the blue Shorten URL button.
7.	Press Ctrl or control+C to copy the shortened URL to your computer's clipboard. For comparison later, paste it into another document.
8.	In the browser's address bar, double-click to highlight the goo.gl and press Command+V to paste the shortened URL.
9.	Press Enter to resolve the URL.
In this example, Google provides both the front-end and back-end processing under its own account (not that of a Google user).


## <a name="from_goo.gl_signed_in"></a> Obtain short URLs manually from goo.gl as a signed-in Google user
Now let's see what happens when the API request occurs by a user signed into Google:

1.	Type in the browser address box Google's URL Shortener home page at http://goo.gl/.
2.	Click Sign in and provide your Google password.
...   ![goo.gl Langing page](http://www.merc.tv/img/fig/goo.gl_landing.png "goo.gl Langing page")

> Notice that the URL you processed anonymously does NOT appear on the list of URLs associated with your Google account because it was created under Google's account. URLs previously shortened using your Google account would show up on this page. 

3.	Type or paste a URL of your choice in the text box under "Paste your long URL here".  (http:// is not needed). 
4.	Double-click on the long URL and press Ctrl or command+C to save it in your clipboard for use later.
5.	Press Shorten URL. 
6.	Paste the long URL and shorten it again.
7.	Press Ctrl or command+C to save it to your clipboard.

> Notice that the shortened URL created for the same long URL is different than the one created before. Also, different short URLs are created for the same long URL input. Other URL shortener services do not have such behavior. With Google, one can have private shortened URLs (to track links from different marketing channels, etc.). That is why authentication is necessary, for Google to report when and how many clicked on particular short URLs.

8.	Open a new browser window. Perhaps a Firefox browser.
9.	Paste the URL in the browser address bar and press Enter to retrieve the page.
10.	Repeat on a different browser or even different operating system.
11.	Return to the Google url shortener window. 
12.	Click the **Details** link associated with the URL you just used. An example of such a link is
http://goo.gl/#analytics/goo.gl/l6MS/all_time created December, 2009.

> Because Google servers resolves short to long URLs, it can track meta information from clients used to view the link. IP addresses of clients can be asociated with the country of origin. The browser, and operating system platform are also provided by client browsers.

Since the link you just created won't have any hits yet, let's take a look at one that has lots of hits over time.

> Notice that codes are case-sensitive.

13. In you internet browser's address, type in http://goo.gl/l6MS.info.

> Notice that analytics for a generated code can be obtained by adding **.info** to the code generated.

...   ![Short URL usage Statistics](http://www.merc.tv/img/fig/goo-gl-analytics.jpg "Statistics")
Image credit: [Mashable](http://mashable.com/2010/09/30/goo-gl-url-shortener/)

> Notice at the upper right corner the QR (Quick Response) graphic image for mobile smartphone readers to obtain the URL.	

14.	To obtain the QR code, change the address by adding *.qr* after the generated code (l6MS) to
http://goo.gl/l6MS.qr


## <a name="from_node_cli"></a> Obtain short URL manually from a Node.js command line
A custom program (not Google) can also provide a way to shorten URLs under its account.

1.	Install node.js with npm on your Windows, Mac OS, or Linux machine.
2.	Install module node-googl into your node.js server:

```
npm install -g goo.gl
```
The module comes from: https://github.com/kaimallea/node-googl

3. At the terminal command line, obtain a short URL by specifying the goo.gl with a host name (without the http protocol):

```
goo.gl     maps.google.com
```

The response would be something like this:

```
http://maps.google.com -> http://goo.gl/fbsS
```

This command can be invoked repeatedly by a calling program processing a list of long URLs. 
The short URL output can be captured into logs by node.js modules such as https://github.com/bevry/caterpillar.


## <a name="from_api_console"></a> Get list of short URLs generated from Google API Explorer for known user
1.	Sign in to your Google account.
2.	Go to Google's API Explorer page: http://developers.google.com/apis-explorer/

3.	Scroll down the list of Google's APIs to select **URL Shortener**, currently at version 1:

http://developers.google.com/apis-explorer/#p/urlshortener/v1/

...   ![Google URLS API Auth](http://www.merc.tv/img/fig/goo.api.auth.png "Google URLS API Auth")

> Notice there are three functions provided by the API (**insert** a new short URL, **get** the long URL, and **list** the URLs).
Because Google manages shortened URLs with authentication, Google can report the creation time and other analytics when it expands short URLs.

4. <a name="Authorize_API"></a> Authorize requests using OAuth 2.0 by clicking/sliding the OFF switch to turn it ON.

...   ![Google URLS API Auth](http://www.merc.tv/img/fig/goo.oauth2.scopes.png "Google URLS API Auth ")

5.	Check to select the scope https://www.googleapis.com/auth/urlshortener.
6.	Click Authorize.

...   ![Google URLS API Auth On](http://www.merc.tv/img/fig/goo.api.auth.on.png "Google URLS API Auth On")

7.	Now that OAuth is ON, click on urlshortener.url.list (without inputting any parameters).
8.	Click Execute.
9.	Scroll down the see Responses containing shortened URLs, such as:
 
...![Google URLS API Auth Json](http://www.merc.tv/img/fig/goo.api.auth.json.png "Google URLS API Auth Json")

10.	Click on URL Shortener API v1 > to return to the list of functions.
11.	Double-click on urlshortener.url.get.
12.	Paste the URL (such as http://goo.gl/maps/QO5Lp).
 
...   ![Google URLS API Auth Execute](http://www.merc.tv/img/fig/goo.api.auth.execute.png "Google URLS API Auth Execute")

13.	Press Execute for the long URL for a response containing both short and long URL.

> Notice the 3 steps involved above outlined in the [workflow diagram above](#Workflow_diagram):
1)	Select and Authorize API with a scope of access
2)	Exchange authorization code for access tokens (which occurs internally)
3)	Configure request to API


## <a name="from_playground"></a> Obtain short URL using Google OAuth 2.0 Playground
Google's OAuth 2.0 Playground works only with active (default) versions of services, and includes some services not listed within the API Explorer.

1.	Sign in to your Google account.
2.	Go to Google's OAuth 2.0 Playground (aka API Console) at: 

https://developers.google.com/oauthplayground/

Alternately, you can instead launch the Google Chrome plug-in:
https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/oauth-20-playground/fcjholccjchiplkbibepfimlaapdaiih

...   ![Google API Playground](http://www.merc.tv/img/fig/goo.play.api_list.png "Google API Playground")

3.	Scroll down in the list and click **URL Shortener API v1**.
4.	Click to select the scope "https://www.googleapis.com/auth/urlshortener".
 
...   ![Google API Scope](http://www.merc.tv/img/fig/goo.play.scope.png "Google API Scope")

> Note that the scope is not used like public URLs, but internally to uniquely identify which Google API is being used.

5.	Click the blue **Authorize API** button to access the scope selected.
 
...   ![Google API Scope](http://www.merc.tv/img/fig/goo.play.manage.png "Google API Scope")

6. <a name="Accept_API"></a> As the user when owns the list, click **Accept**.

...   ![Google API Exchange](http://www.merc.tv/img/fig/goo.play.exchange.png "Google API Exchange")

How this authorization code is created will be described in the next section.

> Notice the authorization code is exchanged only *once* for access tokens which are used on an on-going basis. 
Lukas White [describes it this way](http://www.sitepoint.com/using-json-web-tokens-node-js):
Think of the token like a security pass. You identify yourself at the front desk of a restricted building on arrival (supply your username and password), and if you can be successfully identified you’re issued a security pass. As you move around the building (attempt to access resources by making calls to the API) you are required to show your pass, rather than go through the initial identification process all over again.

7.	Click Exchange authorization code for tokens.
 
...   ![Google API Exchange](http://www.merc.tv/img/fig/goo.play.refresh.png "Google API Exchange")

The Access token is added to communications from the client to establish its authenticity with Google servers. The 3578 seconds shown in this example is considered "short-lived", the time period when the access token remains usable. After that time, the Refresh token needs to be sent to obtain a fresh access token. The format of the packet containing this information is this:

...   ![Google API Access Token](http://www.merc.tv/img/fig/goo.play.access_token.png "Google API Access Token")

> Notice the token_type is "Bearer" (carrier) of the access token as defined in the 
OAuth2 spec.

8.	Click *List possible operations* for the pop-up, then expand **Insert Url**:
 
...   ![Google API Send Request](http://www.merc.tv/img/fig/goo.play.list_ops.png "Google API Send Request")

9.	Click on **Insert Url** to auto-populate the Request URI.
10.	In another browser window, view https://developers.google.com/url-shortener/v1/getting_started?csw=1#actions,
which defines this json-formatted request:

```	
POST https://www.googleapis.com/urlshortener/v1/url
Content-Type: application/json
{"longUrl": "http://www.google.com/"}
```

Also note what a successful response looks like in the sample page.

But instead of www.google.com, you would specify the long URL of your choice.

11. Click **Enter request body** to specify the long URL before pressing Close. For example:

```	
{"longUrl": "http://www.wilsonmar.com/"}
```

...   ![Google API Send Request](http://www.merc.tv/img/fig/goo.play.send_req_2015_02_01.png "Google API Send Request")

12. Click the blue **Send the request** button to obtain a successful (200 OK) response such as this:

```	
{
  "kind": "urlshortener#url", 
  "id": "http://goo.gl/p0eVli", 
  "longUrl": "http://www.wilsonmar.com/"
}
```

# <a name="#Obtain_credentials"></a> Obtain Google API Credentials for automated API calls

The API calls above were obtained by Google manually by [clicking the OFF switch to turn it ON](#Authorize_API)
or [clicking "Accept" Google managing short URLs](#Accept_API).

But when the user is not present to manually do that, 
Google would need something to prove that acceptance was agreed ahead of time.
That acceptance occurs by the user providing a private unique fingerprint key he/she generated
which the computer uses to "sign" requests made on the user's behalf.

Instead of manually signing in with a Google account (email) and typing in a password, 
actions are performed by a **service account**
and electronic keys obtained from the Google API Console for a project at 
https://console.developers.google.com/.

Programs usually only need call pre-defined library functions that accept a service account and private key as input,
and the underlying format of calls are done automatically within the library code.

The diagram here illustrates what happens under the covers:

## <a name="Keygen_dataflow"></a> Key Generation Dataflow

...   ![Dataflow](http://www.merc.tv/img/fig/goo.keygen_dataflow.png "Dataflow")

Like most other major internet sites -- Amazon, Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, Yelp, etc. -- Google implements some form of the OAuth 2.0 standard formally defined at http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749. This spec provides guidelines for token issuing patterns. It does not dictate how identity is validated. So it is up to each service to deploy patterns appropriate for its own use case. Each web service uses a slightly different approach.


## Get service account email for project

1.	Use an internet browser to bring up Google's Developer Console (also called API Console) at  https://console.developers.google.com/project

2.	Define a **project** Google uses project as a container for certificates related to a particular application.
Click on Create Project. Google suggests a PROJECT NAME such as "My Project 1" and a globally unique Project ID consisting of three sets of random words and numbers, such as "applied-algebra-825".

BEST PRACTICE IDEA: Specify a version number after each project name you define.

3.	Click the blue **Create** button.
4.	It may take a few seconds for this activity to complete. When the Project Dashboard appears, click the "X" Activities pop-up to dismiss it.
5.	The URL to reach the Project Dashboard for the project contains the Project ID, such as:
	https://console.developers.google.com/project/applied-algebra-825

This page can be reached again by clicking the APIs link within the APIs & auth menu at the left of the screen.

6.	Bookmark the URL in your browser for each specific API project.
7.	Click the blue **Enable an API** button for a list of Google services enabled. 
8.	Scroll down the list to click on the link to **URL Shortener API**. The response is:

...   ![Console authorize](http://www.merc.tv/img/fig/goo-console.authorize-api.png "Console authorize")

9.	As before, click to the left of the OFF switch to turn it ON.

...   ![Console authorize](http://www.merc.tv/img/fig/goo-console.accept.png "Console authorize")

The API is moved to the top section of active APIs.

10.	Click the checkbox, then the blue Accept button.

...   ![Console accept form](http://www.merc.tv/img/fig/goo-console.quota.png "Console accept form")

11.	Click on the QUOTA tab.

> Notice there is a FREE QUOTA of 1,000,000 requests/day. Google needs authentication to determine who specifically are making calls so that such limits can be monitored and enforced.

12.	Click on the **Credentials** link within the API & auth section at the left menu.

**OAuth** is for accessing data. 

13.	Scroll down to the **Public API** access section.

The API Key is used to track Quota used.

# Why Capture Data from Google?
The following is the narration to this video ___ on YouTube.com and DailyMotion.com ___.
Videos dynamically reveal these illustrations with spoken text.

[While viewing scroll of API Explorer from top to bottom]
...![Google API Explorer sample](http://www.merc.tv/img/fig/google.explorer_list_v01.png "Google API Explorer sample")

This tutorial is a guided exploration for developers to quickly learn, in a hands-on way, how to perform server-to-server communication with Google's many web services.
Google provides a large number of APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) so programs in servers can communicate with other computers directly without human interaction: Information from users of Google's Gmail, Calendar, Drive cloud, Google+, and YouTube videos.
Why would one want to take the extra effort to extract data from Google when one has Gmail, Google maps, and other websites that Google provides? 

Let's take a look at this line chart showing corresponding data series across time.

...   ![Data series from several sources](http://www.merc.tv/img/fig/goo.combined_data_v01.png "Data series")

If you want to add event flags or additional data series **not** in Google servers you might need to have all the data on your **own** server. Google can automatically purge data on its severs anytime it wants. And Google has cancelled many services it has provided. So you need a way of keeping your data where **you** can really control.

<hr />

# Server
In order to not expose credentials in client code, calls to the Google API needs to be made from a server. In our case, from a node.js server. The sample server code is based on use of ???

# JWT vs. JWS vs. JWE

## JWT
JWS is an example of JWT defined in the IETF draft at https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-oauth-json-web-token-32.
JSON Web Token (JWT) is a compact, URL-safe means of representing claims to be transferred between two parties.  The claims in a JWT are encoded as a JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) object that is used as the payload of a JSON Web Signature (JWS) structure or as the plaintext of a JSON Web Encryption (JWE) structure, enabling the claims to be digitally signed or MACed and/or encrypted.

## JWS
(https://github.com/brianloveswords/node-jws)
implements the creation of a
JSON Web Signature (JWS) as defined in http://self-issued.info/docs/draft-ietf-jose-json-web-signature.html
JSON Web Signature (JWS) represents content secured with digital signatures or Message Authentication Codes (MACs) using JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) based data structures. Cryptographic algorithms and identifiers for use with this specification are described in the separate JSON Web Algorithms (JWA) specification and an IANA registry defined by that specification. Related encryption capabilities are described in the separate JSON Web Encryption (JWE) specification.

## JWE
